### Abstract
Adipose tissues constitute a complex and highly plastic tissues with a remarkable ability to adopt to the storage needs of the body. Here, we have applied single nucleus RNA-seq to map epididymal white adipose tissue plasticity at single cell resolution in response to high fat diet-induced obesity. We show that this approach recovers all major cell types, as well as several minor cell populations. This allows us to recover the entire adipogenic trajectory from preadipocyte commitment to mature adipocytes and to identify potential regulatory mechanisms. We show that obesity leads to pro-found changes in the relative contribution of specific cell types, including changes in the relative contribution of adipocyte states, as well as changes in gene expression in all major cell types. The data provide a powerful resource for future hypothesis-driven investigations of the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue plasticity.

### Scripts for reproduction of manuscript figures
The scripts in this repository contains all of the code that was run to create the figures in the manuscript. <br>
Please note that some of the algorithms are non-deterministic, which means that results vary slightly from run to run. <br>
Due to the non-deterministic nature, your figures may not look exactly like the figures in the paper. <br>
To increase reproducibility, processed data (where results of many non-deterministic steps are saved) is also linked. <br>
The scripts can be opened in RStudio and the code chunk within backticks can be executed.<br>
In addition, we have made our data available for browsing at the [Single Cell Portal](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1179) <br>
